# USED CAR SALES IN GERMANY
### Abstract
This study investigates the factors influencing used car prices in Germany using a comprehensive Kaggle dataset. By applying data analysis and machine learning techniques, we identify key relationships between car attributes and selling prices. Utilizing Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression for predictive modeling, the Gradient Boosting model demonstrates the highest accuracy. Leveraging PySpark for big data processing and visualization tools like Tableau, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn, we provide valuable insights for optimizing pricing strategies in the used car market.
### Objectives
1. **Employ PySpark for data loading and processing:** Utilize PySpark to handle and process the dataset efficiently.
2. **Perform data exploration and analysis:** Apply suitable techniques to explore and understand the data.
3. **Visualize data using Tableau or Python libraries:** Use visualization tools to interpret findings effectively.
4. **Implement machine learning models:** Evaluate and apply models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for price prediction.
5. **Discuss findings and insights:** Present a detailed discussion of the results and their implications for the used car market.
### Dataset
This study investigates factors influencing used car prices in Germany using a comprehensive dataset from eBay. The dataset contains 371,539 rows with various attributes related to used cars. Extensive data cleaning was performed, including removing non-contributing features and outliers, such as cars with implausible registration years. The summarized dataset, consisting of 371,539 rows and 11 columns, was used for analysis. German terms were translated to English for clarity. Using PySpark for data processing and various machine learning models, the study provides insights to optimize pricing strategies in the used car market.
