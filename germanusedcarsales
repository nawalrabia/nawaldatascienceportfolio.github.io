# Used Car Price Analysis in Germany

### Abstract

This study investigates the factors influencing used car prices in Germany using a comprehensive Kaggle dataset sourced from eBay. The raw data comprises 371,539 rows with various attributes related to used cars. Extensive data cleaning was performed, including removing non-contributing features and outliers, such as cars with implausible registration years. Due to resource constraints, a summarized dataset with 371,539 rows and 11 columns was used. German terms in the dataset were translated to English for effective analysis. Using PySpark for data processing and various machine learning models, the study provides insights to optimize pricing strategies in the used car market.

### Objectives

1. **Employ PySpark for data loading and processing:** Utilize PySpark to handle and process the dataset efficiently.
2. **Perform data exploration and analysis:** Apply suitable techniques to explore and understand the data.
3. **Visualize data using Tableau or Python libraries:** Use visualization tools to interpret findings effectively.
4. **Implement machine learning models:** Evaluate and apply models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for price prediction.
5. **Discuss findings and insights:** Present a detailed discussion of the results and their implications for the used car market.
